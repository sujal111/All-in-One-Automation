### Project Descripttion

> **The problem All-In-One Automation solves
India is apparently fighting two wars in a way - one is against the pandemic corona virus and other is economic crisis. Most credit rating agencies have drastically cut India's GDP forecast from their earlier today projection. The country's forex reserves are drying, the rupee has taken a hit, exports refusing to pick up and industrial activity has come to a halt. Amid such circumstances, it is pretty clear a distinct, desirable, well planned smart action has to be taken backed by proper deliberation and finally the solution has to be executed.**


As per prominent research papers, itâ€™s apparent that COVID-19 won't be eradicated anytime soon, it will stay with us. Essentially, the best way to re-start and revamp the all sectors and domains which were locked for around 2 months is to prevent it from spreading. We have created a model which would eventually and subsequently combat, control and prevent the spreading or escalation of COVID-19.
Over models is escalating it's clutches in all domains of economy and life, say CORPORATE WORLD, TRAVEL , TOURISM, EDUCATION, HEALTHCARE, AGRICULTURE and hence versatile.

Smart Contract having features such as PRODUCT NAME, BATCH NUMBER,TIME-STAMP EXPIRY DATE and QUALITY CHECKED. A DECENTRALISED EDUCATIONAL APP has been created with Blockchain based Ethereum. In terms of deployment, we have used both - MATIC NETWORK and metamask too.Matic network has certified proper and effecient deployment of the smart contracts of supply chain management and education as well.

ALL IN ONE AUTOMATION WHICH INCLUDES CAPTURING OF IMAGES AND DETECTING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE BODY ABOVE ANY STANDARD. BROADLY, WE HAVE ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT PORTAL FOR CORPORATE SECTORS WHICH INCLUDES FACE MASK DETECTION, IMAGE RECOGNITION AND VOICE DETECTION.
SUPPLY CHAIN WAS HIT DUE TO COVID-19. ETHEREUM BASED SMART CONTRACT AND TRANSACTION ARE CREATED FOR FLEXIBILITY AND ALSO DECENTRALISED EDUCATIONAL APP IS CREATED FOR BOOSTING TEACHING-LEARNING PROCESS.

## Challenges in this Project

> There was a hurdle in creating this model as we weren't able to get the dataset for our model.

> Getting proper accuracy was another rugged work which took never-ending time to complete.

> Coding the smart contract with solidity for the supply chain was a brainstorming task as there were some more 1700 files generated due to js and bootstrap together.

> Deploying into matic network was another resilient task as it took lot of time to correct and link different files together
